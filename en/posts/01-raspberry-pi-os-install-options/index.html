Getting its operating system set up has gotten a lot easier lately. It’s not just about burning an SD card anymore. Now you can create users, turn on SSH, set up networks, and even boot from USB or an M.2 SSD (for the Pi 5).\nIn this article, I’m not going to deep-dive into just one setup method. Instead, I’ll cover all your options for installing Raspberry Pi OS across different operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS, and help you figure out which approach makes the most sense for you.\nThe official way: Raspberry Pi Imager Why did we need the Raspberry Pi Imager? Back in the early days of Raspberry Pi, there wasn’t a single official tool for installation. Installing Raspberry Pi OS (which was called Raspbian back then) meant manually downloading an image, using separate programs like dd or Win32 Disk Imager, and you absolutely needed a monitor and keyboard for the first boot. The system always started with the default pi / raspberry user.\nRunning it headless (without a monitor or keyboard) became possible later through unofficial or undocumented tricks, like an empty ssh file or a manually created wpa_supplicant.conf. These worked, but they weren’t easy for beginners and it was easy to mess things up.\nThe Raspberry Pi Imager came along to replace that scattered process with one easy-to-use graphical tool. Its main goal was to make installing the OS much friendlier, without losing the ability to do advanced setups.\nNow, the Raspberry Pi Imager, made by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, is pretty much the go-to tool for installing Raspberry Pi OS.\nWhat can the Raspberry Pi Imager do? Download Raspberry Pi OS (and other operating systems) Write the image to an SD card or USB drive Pre-configure settings like: Username and password Enable SSH Device hostname Wi-Fi settings Location (time zone, keyboard layout) Raspberry Pi Connect setup It’s recommended to set up your user, a strong password, and enable SSH with key-based authentication (if you’ll access the Pi remotely) right from here. That way, after the first boot, your system is pretty much ready to go.\nIf you don’t need a graphical interface or desktop apps, picking Raspberry Pi OS Lite is good idea. It uses fewer computer resources, boots faster, and has a smaller attack surface.\nWhat operating systems is it available on? Windows macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon) Linux (AppImage, package manager, or Flatpak) Advantages and bad points Advantages:\nEasy for beginners Fast Fewer mistakes Disadvantages:\nLess control over what’s happening behind the scenes Limited for automating tasks Installing Raspberry Pi OS on Linux, without the Imager Many Linux users still prefer the classic, manual methods.\nBasic steps: Download the Raspberry Pi OS image (ZIP or XZ) Unzip it Write it to an SD card or USB device, for example, using ‘dd’ This method works on any Linux distribution, but you need to be careful, especially when picking the right drive.\nHeadless setup with files You can pre-configure the system using files placed on the boot partition, or in more advanced cases, by changing files on the system partition:\nssh – to enable SSH userconf / userconf.txt – to create a user wpa_supplicant.conf – for Wi-Fi settings Add SSH keys Set config.txt This solution is great for scripting, making it perfect for automated setups.\nAdvantages and disadvantages Advantages:\nComplete control Easy to integrate into CI / provisioning Disadvantages:\nEasy to make mistakes More manual steps Installing on Windows On Windows, the Raspberry Pi Imager is pretty much essential.\nTools you can use: Raspberry Pi Imager (recommended) Balena Etcher Win32 Disk Imager (more for older systems) Common problems: Picking the wrong drive Permission issues Antivirus interfering during image writing Installing on macOS On macOS, the Imager is also the easiest way, but using command-line tools is also popular.\nCommand-line tools: diskutil – to find drives dd – to write the image Common pitfalls: Drives automatically mounting while writing Permission requests to access the device Special situations Raspberry Pi OS Lite versus Desktop The Desktop version includes a graphical interface and pre-installed apps, which is nice for learning or general desktop use. But if your Pi is a server, runs a service, or is an embedded device, the Lite version is better. It uses fewer resources, starts faster, and has a smaller attack surface.\nBoot from USB drive Starting with the Pi 4, you can boot from USB drives (like flash drives or SSDs). USB storage is generally faster and more reliable than a microSD card, especially for continuous use or tasks that involve a lot of data, like a database.\nWhich method should you pick? Beginner user: Raspberry Pi Imager Headless server: Imager or manual Linux method Multiple Pis, automation: Manual image setup + scripting Summary There are now many ways to install Raspberry Pi OS, and there isn’t one perfect method for everyone. The new Raspberry Pi Imager solves a lot of old headaches, but in a Linux environment, there’s still a place for manual, scriptable approaches.\n","wordCount":"860","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2026-01-06T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2026-01-06T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://pano-peter.github.io/homelab-notes/en/posts/01-raspberry-pi-os-install-options/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Homelab Notes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://pano-peter.github.io/homelab-notes/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://pano-peter.github.io/homelab-notes/en/ accesskey=h title="Homelab Notes (Alt + H)">Homelab Notes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
